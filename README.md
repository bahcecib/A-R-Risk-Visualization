# A-R-Risk-Visualization
This script visualizes the A/R risk of a customer with respect to their FINAR score.

It gets an Excel file with Customer Name, A/R amount and CRIF score columns. 

It assigns color based on where the customer stands with respect to mean and standard deviation. Color assignment was found in StackExchange and it is not my own.
